{"name":"Oscar Nights","tagline":"A predictive model for Academy Award performance by Antonio Coppola and Andy Shi, Harvard University.","body":"### Welcome to Oscar Nights\r\nOscar Nights is a project realized for Harvard's Computer Science 109: Data Science. We aim to discover which movie features (budget, director, review statistics, etc…) are predictive of success on the night of the Academy Awards, and to see how well a classifier can predict Oscar nominations and Oscar winnings. The project comes in the form of an iPython notebook, with associated data files. In order to execute the code, extract the contents of the project archive locally, and then launch iPython.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/o6YXdTeuDCA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Project Specifications\r\nWe build two classifiers: one allows us to predict whether a movie will be *nominated for at least one Oscar*, and the other allows us to predict whether an Oscar nominee *will win at least one Oscar*. Aside from building the predictive model, we are also interested in observing which features happen to be the most important predictors in the model.\r\n\r\nWe train the classifiers on data for over 1000 movies released between 2005-2009 from Noah Smith's [Movies Data Corpus](http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/movie$-data/). This data includes movie reviews from sources such as the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/pages/movies/index.html) and the [Austin Chronicle](http://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/). In order to quantify the positiveness of the movie reviews (this task is commonly refer to as *sentiment analysis*), we also use [training data](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/) from Bo Pang, Lillian Lee, and Shivakumar Vaithyanathan.\r\n\r\n### The Results\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
